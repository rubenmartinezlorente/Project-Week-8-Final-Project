## Project Description
This is the final project performed in the Data analytics Ironhack school of Barcelona(Spain). The goal of the project is called *RENEWABLE & NO-RENEWABLE ENERGIES: Are we ready?*. Through different datasets from  offical websites of energy information, we clean and explore the data to answer some questions we wonder (see [Hypotheses / Questions](#hypotheses-questions)).

The motivation of this project is make a review of the different renewable, so-called **RE**, and no renewable energies, so-called **NREa**. Energy concept is a topic that moves billions of dollars around the world. It is one of the most important, rich, powerful and basic business that support the humankind. You think if there is not such business, almost part of the life we conceive daily it would not exist.

Currently, is one of the most important issue in the world due to the climating emergency. Nowdays, the XXVth edition of **UN Climate Change Conference(COP25)** takes places in Madrid (Spain) from December 2nd to 13th (See [COP25](https://unclimatesummit.org/))

 With all data, using statistics tools and machine learning algorithms predict **how ready is the humanankind to implement renewable energies and not use fosile(not renewables) energies**

We 
## Hypotheses / Questions
* Our initial(null) hypothesis *H0* is: **the society is already ready to implement renewable energy, without the non-renewable dependency**
    * How to answer?

        We analyze all data regarding of last 3 decades such as consumption, trades, installations and need to energy from a NRE and RE.

        With the NRE data, we compare with the RE currently and we compare if we can use all demand of energy with RE.

* The question we want to answer is reject or ratify the *null hypothesis*

* Besides of answering the main question, we are going to **contextualize the current situation** in the Earth in reference with the renewable energies introducint different interesting features like: 

    1. Consumption of RE and NRE.

    2. Installations of RE setup.

    3. Trade and prices of RE and NRE around the world (or main hot points).

* Finally, with the Energy situation contextualized, and a clearer working of the energy-market, how could be the next steps in the market.



## Dataset
Information used in this project is provided from the [US. European Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/). In particular we use a interface from International Energy Statistics. There are much more information from what we need for this project and they have to be cleaned.
In particular we use the following information from the 229 countries along 37 years (from 1980 to 2017):

* Consumption: Net electricity consumpted by countries measured in Billions of KiloWatts per hour (b. Kwh)
* Generation: Electricity generated by county (b. Kwh). 
In this dataset (so-called 'superdataset') we have 4 different dataset that repeats ciclilly along 229 rows (countries) (see [Cleaning]).
    + Renewable
    + Fossile (Non Renewable)
    + Nuclear
    + Hydrodynamical pumped store


* Capacity: Electricity able to produce in the *installations* by county (b. Kwh).
Analogue situation than in generation dataset. This dataset (so-called 'superdataset') we have 4 different dataset that repeats ciclilly along 229 rows (countries) (see [Cleaning]).
    + Renewable
    + Fossile (Non Renewable)
    + Nuclear
    + Hydrodynamical pumped store

* Imports: in b. Kwh
* Exports: in b. Kwh
* C02 emissions: emissions measured in million metric tons carbon dioxide 

Also, from the same website, we use different countries ranking measures (same as above) to make a quick description in the current energetic situation (2017).

From these datasets, we make a data cleaning and data exploring to prepare ready for the last step: Time Series -Machine Learning-

## Cleaning
Data Cleaning is named the Jupyter notebook file: **1.data_cleaning.ipnyb** is splitted in two different steps:
* 1st step **SLICING SUPERDATASET**: For Generation and Capacity superdatasets we define a function we slice these superdatasets in five small ones.

* 2nd step **CLEANING DATASET**: Define two functions (*clean1*, *clean2*) to automatize the cleaning for all dataset we have. I checked previously that all of them share the same 'deffects', which are the following ones:

* 1 dropping the empty  and the units columns. 

    *Clean 1* drops the two first rows, *Clean 2* drops the first row.

* 2 dropping the first 2 rows because there are the quantity to analyze and the category

* 3 rename the country column

* 4 Set'country' index

* 5 Replacing '--', '-' for nan. I discover for trial and error.

* 6 Drop the missing values.

* 7 Convert the data from objetct to number (float or int)

* 8  Transpose the matrix to have the country as index and year as columns.

* 3rd step **SAVING DATA**: We save all datasets in different  .csv files in the folder **CLEANED_DATA**

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you went through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work.
* If you used Machine Learning in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the questions you try to answer.

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How did you test the accuracy of your analysis and/or machine learning algorithm?

## Organization
The organization of the project for different kind of task: from technical ones (data cleaning, data exploring, etc.) to more organizational tasks.
You can find a more detailed information in Trello (see [Trello](https://trello.com/en)).

The *GitHub* repository is organized with the following struture:
