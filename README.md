## Project Description
This is the final project performed in the Data analytics Ironhack school of Barcelona (Spain). The project is based in analayze and stimate how ready are the countries in the new century for clean and green sources of energey.

 Through different datasets from a [US. European Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/), I analyze in 4 different modules all need information to answer the main questions (see [Hypotheses / Questions](#hypotheses-questions)).

The motivation of this project is make a review of the different renewable, so-called **RE**, and no renewable energies, so-called **NRE**. Energy concept is a topic that moves billions of dollars around the world. It is one of the most important, rich, powerful and basic business that support the humankind. You think if there is not such business, almost part of the life we conceive daily it would not exist.

Currently, is one of the most important issue in the world due to the climating emergency. Nowdays, the XXVth edition of **UN Climate Change Conference(COP25)** takes places in Madrid (Spain) from December 2nd to 13th (See [COP25](https://unclimatesummit.org/))

 With all data, using statistics tools and machine learning algorithms we want to cluster the countries about **how ready are these countries to implement renewable energies and not use fosile(not renewables) energies in the next decades**

## Hypotheses / Questions

**The society (countries in particular) is already ready to implement renewable energy, without the non-renewable dependency?**
* How to answer?
I notice the answer is very generic and ambiguous, for this reason, we have a step-to-step plan that we can answer with enought preccision. The plan consists in 4 sections with a very clear purpose:
 1. **Data cleaning**: Clean and organize the dataset to be useful for the next modules.
 2. **Data Analysis**: The second module helps us to understand what is the current worldwide scenario about the energy consumption (net, renewable and no renewable).
 3. **Statistics**: This module stimate in a *very simple stimation* (not using Machine Learning) the trends of the countries appliying the linear regression method for the next 80 years (2020-2100). With these data we propose a classification of green and not one countries (in reference of how much renewable energy use that country).
 4.**Machine Learning**: The last module we use unsupervised machine learning to cluster the countries (same number of cluster using in module three) using different features with NO or LOW correlation with energy attributes (population, GDP).

## Dataset
The information used in this project is sourced from the [US. European Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/). In particular, we use a interface from International Energy Statistics where we can choose with attribute (pretty much correlated with energy such as renewable generation or nothing correlated, like population of countries).

There are much more information from what we need for this project and they have to be cleaned.
In particular we use the following information from the 229 countries along 37 years (from 1980 to 2017).
All these datasets, you can find in a .zip file in the folder **raw_data**.

* Consumption: Net electricity consumpted by countries measured in Billions of KiloWatts per hour (b. Kwh)
* Generation: Electricity generated by county (b. Kwh). 
In this dataset (so-called 'superdataset') we have 4 different dataset that repeats ciclilly along 229 rows (countries) (see [Cleaning]).
    + Renewable
    + Fossile (Non Renewable)
    + Nuclear
    + Hydrodynamical pumped store


* Capacity: Electricity able to produce in the *installations* by county (b. Kwh).
Analogue situation than in generation dataset. This dataset (so-called 'superdataset') we have 4 different dataset that repeats ciclilly along 229 rows (countries) (see [Cleaning]).
    + Renewable
    + Fossile (Non Renewable)
    + Nuclear
    + Hydrodynamical pumped store

* Imports: in b. Kwh
* Exports: in b. Kwh
* C02 emissions: emissions measured in million metric tons carbon dioxide 
* Population
* GDP:Gross domestic product

Also, from the same website, we use different countries ranking measures to make a quick description in the current energetic situation (2017):
* net electricity consumption
* renewable generation
* fossile (no renewale) generation 
* C02 emission

## Cleaning
Data Cleaning information you may find in the folder **jupyter_noteooks**, the file **1.data_cleaning.ipnyb**. It is splitted in two different steps:
### 1st step **SLICING SUPERDATASET**
For Generation and Capacity superdatasets we define a function we slice these superdatasets in five small ones.

### 2nd step **CLEANING DATASET**
 Define two functions (*clean1*, *clean2*) to automatize the cleaning for all dataset we have. I checked previously that all of them share the same 'deffects', which are the following ones:

* 1 dropping the empty  and the units columns. 

    *Clean 1* drops the two first rows, *Clean 2* drops the first row.

* 2 dropping the first 2 rows because there are the quantity to analyze and the category

* 3 rename the country column

* 4 Set'country' index

* 5 Replacing '--', '-' for nan. I discover for trial and error.

* 6 Drop the missing values.

* 7 Convert the data from objetct to number (float or int)

* 8  Transpose the matrix to have the country as index and year as columns.

### 3rd step **Read and clean the ranking datasets**
I clean (I found these data pretty cleaned) a bit transforming some columns such as 'Value' in float64 and dropping a empty columnn.

### 4th step **SAVING DATA**
I save all datasets in different .csv files in the folder **CLEANED_DATA** to read in the Analysis part.

## Analysis
You can find Data Analysis module  in the folder **Jupyter_notebooks**in the Jupyter notebook file: *1.data_analysis.ipnyb*. 
The description of the current energetic situation thourgh plots and descriptive analysis. 
The data analysis in 3 steps:

 ### 1.Evolution of  countries in renewable energy consumption.

Plots of some countries showing the eletricity net consumption, the renewable and fossilie (no renewable) generation and installatins. 

From these plots, we can extract an additional feature in the Machine Learning model: Check if the renewable energy absolute variation is higher than non-renewable absolute variation. If it is so, we can proceed to apply the Machine Learning algorithm, if it is not, renewable energy can converge with the electricity net demand of society.

 ### 2.Analysis for the *Generation renowable ratio* for all countries: 
We want to show through different kind of plots the current renewable electricity situation is in the world.
For this porpusse, we use Tablelau as visualization tool [Tableau]as visualization support to map different metrics such as, how is the balance of trade (exports-imports), how are the Ranking of the renewable, no-renewable or net electricity consumption countries. 

The dataframe (.csv) I use to make these plots you can find in the folder **explored_data** as *datamaster.csv*

## Statistics
This third module you can find also in the folder **jupyter_notebooks** as **3.statistics_linear_regression**. In this module I stimate the net electricity consumption, the generation of renewable and fossile (no renewable) energy for the next 80 years (from 2020 to 2100).

Once I know this stimation, we create three dataframes (consum_future,renewable_future and norenewable_future) and applying a critero, we catalogue all countries in four different kinds. 
The criterio is based in the assumption of which is the ratio of renewable generation and no renewable generation over the net electricity consumption. As the linear regression just provide a trend, we just choose the last year stimated (2100). You can find the plots generated for some countries in the folder  **plot_countries** inside of the folder **statistics_linear_regression** as *label_countries.csv*.
The criterio is the following:
Notation:
 RE: Renowable energy generation
 NRE: No renewable energy generation
 NET: Net electricity consumption

**GREEN LIGHT COUNTRIES**: RE > 0.7NET & NRE < 0.3NET

**WARNING COUNTRIES** :  RE > 0.7NET & NRE > 0.3NET

**DANGEROUS COUNTRIES**:  RE < 0.7NET & NRE < 0.3NET

**TOXIC COUNTRIES**  RE < 0.7NET & NRE > 0.3NET

The information of labeled countries you can find in the folder **statistics_linear_regression** as *label_countries.csv*

## Machine Learning
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

## Conclusion
The conclusions of this project are the following:

- 1. I answered to the main goal about if countries will be able to be ecologically sustainable in the coming future. The estimation computed says a clear NO.

- 2. I applied different data tools and methodologies to get a concise answer (Statistics, unsupervised machine learning, etc.)


## Future Work
Using the current data apply time-series.
Issue: We just have annual variation (38 points) to train the data. We can compare if the prediction is more accurate than the estimation done by Statistics (just for lustrum/decade)
Deeper analysis using different renewables and non renewable energy sources (wind, solar, nuclear, petroleum, etc.)
